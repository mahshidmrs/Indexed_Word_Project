# Indexed_Word_Project

Write a program that prints index words (words starting with capital letters) along with their word number (the order they appear in the text). If no words with this feature are found in the text, print "None" in the output. Words that appear at the beginning of a sentence should not be considered as index words. (Start numbering words from one).

Numbers should not be counted as index words. The only punctuation marks used in the sentence are period (.) and comma (,). Be careful to remove them if they appear at the end of a word.
